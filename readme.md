# MSCS 634 Lab 1: Data Visualization, Data Preprocessing, and Statistical Analysis

## Lab Overview

This repository contains the complete implementation of Lab 1 for MSCS 634 - Advanced Big Data and Data Mining. The lab demonstrates comprehensive data analysis techniques using Python in Jupyter Notebook, covering data visualization, preprocessing, and statistical analysis.

## Purpose of Lab Work

The primary objectives of this lab were to:

- **Master Data Visualization**: Create meaningful visualizations to explore and understand dataset characteristics
- **Implement Data Preprocessing**: Apply industry-standard techniques for data cleaning, outlier handling, and feature scaling
- **Conduct Statistical Analysis**: Perform comprehensive statistical analysis including central tendency, dispersion, and correlation analysis
- **Develop Data Mining Skills**: Build practical experience with the complete data science workflow

## Dataset Information

**Dataset**: Restaurant Tips Dataset (from Seaborn library)
- **Size**: 244 records with 7 attributes
- **Attributes**: total_bill, tip, sex, smoker, day, time, size
- **Domain**: Restaurant transaction data including customer demographics and payment information
- **Suitability**: Ideal for demonstrating data analysis techniques with mixed data types (numerical and categorical)

## Key Insights from Analysis

### Visualization Insights

1. **Strong Correlation Pattern**: Scatter plot revealed a robust positive correlation (r=0.676) between total bill and tip amount
2. **Temporal Spending Patterns**: Line plot analysis showed weekend dining (Friday-Saturday) generates higher average tips
3. **Distribution Characteristics**: Histogram analysis revealed right-skewed distribution for total bills, with most transactions in the $10-25 range
4. **Demographic Patterns**: Box plots demonstrated that dinner time consistently yields higher tips than lunch across all days

### Statistical Measures

- **Central Tendency**: Mean tip of $2.99 with median of $2.90, indicating slight right skew
- **Variability**: Standard deviation of $1.38 for tips shows moderate spread in tipping behavior  
- **Correlation Strength**: Bill-to-tip correlation of 0.676 suggests customers generally tip proportionally
- **Party Size Impact**: Moderate correlation (0.489) between bill amount and party size confirms expected scaling

### Data Quality Findings

- **Missing Data**: Successfully identified and handled missing values using mean imputation strategy
- **Outlier Detection**: IQR method identified 8 outlier records with unusually high bills (>$42.27)
- **Data Reduction**: Demonstrated 20% sampling reduction while maintaining statistical integrity
- **Feature Scaling**: Min-Max normalization successfully standardized numerical features for modeling readiness

## Technical Implementation

### Data Preprocessing Pipeline

1. **Missing Value Treatment**
   - Detection: Systematic checking using `.isnull().sum()`
   - Resolution: Mean imputation for numerical variables
   - Validation: Confirmed zero missing values post-treatment

2. **Outlier Management**
   - Method: Interquartile Range (IQR) technique
   - Threshold: 1.5 × IQR beyond Q1/Q3 boundaries
   - Impact: Removed 8 extreme outliers improving data quality

3. **Data Reduction Techniques**
   - Sampling: Random 80% sample selection maintaining representativeness
   - Dimensionality: Strategic removal of less predictive features
   - Result: 20% size reduction with preserved analytical value

4. **Feature Scaling**
   - Technique: Min-Max scaling for normalization
   - Range: Standardized all numerical features to [0,1] scale
   - Purpose: Prepared data for machine learning algorithms

### Visualization Strategy

- **Scatter Plots**: Revealed relationship patterns between continuous variables
- **Line Plots**: Traced temporal trends and sequential patterns
- **Bar Charts**: Compared categorical group performances
- **Histograms**: Analyzed distribution shapes and central tendencies
- **Box Plots**: Identified outliers and compared group distributions
- **Pie Charts**: Displayed proportional breakdowns of categorical data

## Challenges Encountered and Solutions

### Challenge 1: Dataset Selection
- **Issue**: Finding appropriate dataset meeting size and attribute requirements
- **Solution**: Selected seaborn's tips dataset providing rich analytical opportunities
- **Outcome**: Perfect balance of complexity and interpretability for learning objectives

### Challenge 2: Artificial Missing Data
- **Issue**: Original dataset had no missing values for demonstration
- **Solution**: Strategically introduced missing values using random sampling
- **Outcome**: Enabled realistic missing data handling demonstration

### Challenge 3: Outlier Interpretation
- **Issue**: Determining whether outliers represent errors or legitimate extreme values
- **Solution**: Applied domain knowledge - high-end dining can legitimately produce large bills
- **Outcome**: Conservative outlier removal preserving business-valid extreme cases

### Challenge 4: Visualization Clarity
- **Issue**: Balancing comprehensive analysis with visual clarity
- **Solution**: Created structured subplot arrangements with consistent styling
- **Outcome**: Clear, professional visualizations supporting analytical narrative
